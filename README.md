# mars-web-scraping-challenge

In this project we demonstrate our webscraping abilities and then demonstrate the ability to turn those objects into mutable file types such as json and csv files. We scraped the data from a website hosting stats about  mars. We used splinter, beautiful soup, matplotlib, pandas, and numpy to initially pull the data and hold the data. then pandas numpy, and matplotlib were used to set up the dataframe, used to find advanced stats, and then visualize them.
